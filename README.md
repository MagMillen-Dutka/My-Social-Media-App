# My-Social-Media-App

## Description:
The application is designed to make the large amount of social media data more rapidly, and more easily accessible. 
Social media platforms deal with millions of pieces of data each second, including logging in, creating new posts, creating new users and much more.

Therefore it is important to have a system in the background which effectively powers user' thoughts, reactions and connections.

This API does this through a MongoDB database, using Express/js for routing and a JavaScript library for the date stamping.
